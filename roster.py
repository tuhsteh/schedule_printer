#  List of people to be used for scheduling.
#  Note that the names can certainly be changed,
#  but the structure of this file MUST remain
#  unchanged.
#  Each list below is an array of strings.
#  Each string must be contained in quotes,
#  and string items must be comma delimited.
#  They are placed on separate lines only
#  for readability, and this is not required.
#
#  This list is constructed as a list of lists.
#  Each service will get its own list of people.
#  Then, people can choose for which service they
#  would like to serve.  Currently, there are
#  two separate lists.
